# ECC-Washington
Basic implementation of modular Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Python.
For an introduction to number theory and ECC please refer to :
[1] "Introduction to Modern Cryptograpy with Coding Theory" Washington 2006

Some of the algorithms for fast number theory implementations will be taken from
[2]"Handbook of Applied Cryptography" by  Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone 2001
